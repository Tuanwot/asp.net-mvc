hi, My first name is Tuan ( full is name Truong Anh Tuan). Currently, Iam studying at Fpt Greenwich University

-> Currently(12/9/2021), iam relearn about database, and i dont have any experience for working on github. thus, this brand may have something wrong.
-> on going to comit my assignment on this brand
-> I not really finish assingment project, there is some bug, but due to limited of time, i have to commit the project right away.About the project, it is a course management system develop on visual studio(2019) using asp.net MVC framework. i did 7 new project while doing assignment. Each of them have a change. if you ask why i have so many project on only 1 assignment. it is because of razor view, i know CSS, Javascript, and html. but it not familair with razor view, so that i have to use view of the template for my project.

-> github said my project to big, and it not allow me commit those 7 files into it( file not more than 100 and less 25 MB weight) and on visual studio, it not repsond while commit file ( i dont know what is going on). Now, i going to decompose those 7 project into peice to create 8th project and comit it on github. (i hope it will work)
-> there is something wrong with git on visual studio. after i try to clone res, the visual studio is broken( its not response).
->bc i cant upload a whole project into github so that i uploaded involved files on github. these file are View, model,and controllers. i will upload whole project into google driver. in the assignment doc i put link of github and link of google driver at the end.
